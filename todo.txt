1. The app automatically adds todo based on a different platform where we save our links, as like we save a post on LinkedIn or save something on a youtube playlist or some post on Facebook or medium blog as such. (Automatically)

1. Add Profile section in the 3 rd tab and edit profile option

3. 3 Add image cropping 


A collection of all your links that you want to read in the future your web URLs, screenshots, and YouTube link, and many more 

So it's a database of your todos and also adds todo according to that

Add google search at the top that is linked webview.

Also, we can make it social, so that others can see each other todos or 
saved URL.

We will also make a chrome extension to easily add todo.

In my opinion , It's throwing this error because of the time which you selected is before than now . In their pub.dev page , there is an example for solve this problem .

tz.TZDateTime _nextInstanceOfTenAM() {
final tz.TZDateTime now = tz.TZDateTime.now(tz.local);
tz.TZDateTime scheduledDate =
    tz.TZDateTime(tz.local, now.year, now.month, now.day, 10);
if (scheduledDate.isBefore(now)) {
  scheduledDate = scheduledDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
}
return scheduledDate;
}

E/flutter (26700): When an inherited widget changes, for example if the value of Theme.of() changes, its dependent widgets are rebuilt. If the dependent widget's reference to the inherited widget is in a constructor or an initState() method, then the rebuilt dependent widget will not reflect the changes in the inherited widget.
