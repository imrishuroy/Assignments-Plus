In my opinion , It's throwing this error because of the time which you selected is before than now . In their pub.dev page , there is an example for solve this problem .

tz.TZDateTime _nextInstanceOfTenAM() {
final tz.TZDateTime now = tz.TZDateTime.now(tz.local);
tz.TZDateTime scheduledDate =
    tz.TZDateTime(tz.local, now.year, now.month, now.day, 10);
if (scheduledDate.isBefore(now)) {
  scheduledDate = scheduledDate.add(const Duration(days: 1));
}
return scheduledDate;
}

E/flutter (26700): When an inherited widget changes, for example if the value of Theme.of() changes, its dependent widgets are rebuilt. If the dependent widget's reference to the inherited widget is in a constructor or an initState() method, then the rebuilt dependent widget will not reflect the changes in the inherited widget.
